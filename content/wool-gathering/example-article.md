This is an example article. When you create new articles in the `wool-gathering` folder, they will automatically appear as cards on the wool-gathering page.

## How It Works

1. Create a new `.md` file in `content/wool-gathering/`
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, date, and tags
3. Write your content below
4. The article will appear as a card on the wool-gathering page
5. Clicking the card takes you to the full article page

## Next Steps

Delete this example file and create your own articles using the `_template.md` as a starting point.
