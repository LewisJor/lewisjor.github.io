I'm a software engineer with a passion for building scalable systems and applying ai & machine learning to solve real-world problems. My path has been shaped by military service, technical education, and hands-on experience building production systems.

## Background

After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, I transitioned to software engineering, earning a Master's in Data Analytics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Bachelors in information systems from Edgewood College. This combination of leadership experience and technical depth informs how I approach complex engineering challenges.

## What I Do

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Guidewire Software, where I focus on MLOps infrastructure and building ml/ai solutions. My work spans distributed systems, API design, and creating scalable architectures that support company-wide ML initiatives.

Previously, I was a lead engineer at State Farm on a cross platform team, worked on enterprise systems at American Family Insurance, and built insurance technology at Sentry Insurance. Across these roles, I've specialized in distributed systems, software engineering, SRE, and optimizing high-throughput processing systems.

## Technical Interests

I'm particularly interested in:
- **MLOps & Infrastructure**: Building platforms that make ML deployment reliable and scalable
- **Distributed Systems**: Designing resilient architectures that handle real-world constraints
- **Edge Computing**: Systems that operate in disconnected or resource-constrained environments
- **Defense Technology**: Applying advanced ML to mission-critical applications

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with others working on challenging technical problems. Whether it is at a coffee shop or 4000 miles away. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrlewisjor/).
