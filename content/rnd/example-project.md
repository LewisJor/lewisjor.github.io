This is an example project. When you create new projects in the `rnd` folder, they will automatically appear as cards on the r&d page.

## How It Works

1. Create a new `.md` file in `content/rnd/`
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, date, and tech stack
3. Write your content below
4. The project will appear as a card on the r&d page
5. Clicking the card takes you to the full project page

## Next Steps

Delete this example file and create your own projects using the `_template.md` as a starting point.
